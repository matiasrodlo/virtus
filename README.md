E-commerce - Wood Sunglasses (CLP) (2016)

**Pitch:** https://youtu.be/-wVrKc2BdXI

**Description:** E-commerce (B2B2C). 2 collections of wooden eyewear. Distribution in Chile, Peru, and Mexico

**Context:** When I finished high school, I decided not to attend university and, instead, started founding internet companies. This was one of the projects I undertook during that period.

*The name was changed from Virtus to Ozader for a strategic reason.*
